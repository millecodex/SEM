h2: the amount of variance in the item/variable explained by the (retained) components. It is the sum of the squared loadings, a.k.a. communality. For example, population is almost completely explained by the three components

u2: 1 - h2

com: A measure of complexity. A value of 1 might be seen for something that loaded on only one component, and zero otherwise (a.k.a. perfect simple structure).
